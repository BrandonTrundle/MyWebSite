        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">My Journey</h1>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I started working in restaurants when I was around 19 years old. I
          genuinely enjoyed the work. It was honest, fast-paced, and rewarding.
          I loved meeting new people and serving my community, especially during
          times of need. In the southeastern U.S., hurricanes are a regular
          occurrence, and during those times, being able to offer food and
          service meant a lot to me.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          After working my way up through Coastal Pizza LLC, I was promoted from
          manager to Area Supervisor, responsible for all 13 store locations.
          Alongside a trusted colleague, I ensured that each store operated as
          smoothly, cleanly, and consistently as possible. Despite the long
          hours, I still made time for my family and loved ones.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          During that time, I built internal tools to improve operational
          efficiency. One of those tools was an automated inventory tracking
          system using Excel that generated and emailed reports to stakeholders.
          These tools helped reduce the industry’s notorious margin for error.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          After more than six years in that role, I took a leap of faith. I
          partnered with a former colleague who had left Coastal Pizza to start
          his own business. Together, we formed TTRB Holdings and purchased one
          of Coastal Pizza’s stores, along with another location in Beaufort,
          South Carolina. I left my job to focus on our new venture full-time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The business went well for a while, and during our second year of
          ownership, my son was born. That moment shifted everything for me. I
          realized just how much time ownership was demanding, and itr was far
          more than even my previous supervisory role. I was missing out on
          precious time with my newborn son and wife.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Our business model relied heavily on
          walk-in traffic and had no delivery infrastructure. The stay-at-home
          orders devastated our operations. Despite our best efforts, we were
          ultimately forced to sell both locations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          In the transitional period after the sale, I faced a career
          crossroads. I finally had a week of rest. It was something I hadn’t
          had in years and it was exactly the pause I needed to reflect. My
          wife, who is originally from Germany, and I began discussing what our
          future might look like. Ultimately, we decided to move to Germany. I
          would learn the language and pursue a career in IT, specifically
          software development.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          So we packed up or sold 10 years’ worth of memories and belongings and
          moved across the ocean — me, my wife, our 1-year-old son, and our two
          cats. I miss my big old truck, and my Magic: The Gathering card
          collection (which I’d been growing since middle school), but I knew we
          were headed for something meaningful.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Shortly after arriving, I enrolled in a language and integration
          course at AAW in Ettlingen. I loved learning about German culture
          especially some of the sayings. I eventually earned my B1 language
          certificate. From there, I joined the Reha-Vorbereitung program at BFW
          Schömberg.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I hadn’t been in school for a long time, and certainly never in a
          foreign language. The first six months were tough, but my teachers
          encouraged me and even had me do public speaking. Gradually, I became
          more confident and capable. While I'm not a native speaker yet, I
          understand German at a solid level and continue to improve.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          After completing the preparation phase, I moved on to a two-year
          software development program at BFW that culminated in the IHK
          certification exam. The IHK tests were intense. They were timed,
          comprehensive, and entirely in German. Passing them was far from
          guaranteed, but I studied hard and succeeded.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          During my studies, I also completed a five-month internship at BRC
          Solar in Ettlingen. It was there that I truly honed my skills, gained
          confidence in my coding approach, and learned firsthand from an
          experienced senior developer.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Today, I’m searching for the right opportunity, and am ready to apply
          everything I’ve learned, driven by passion and shaped by a unique
          journey that spans two continents, multiple careers, and a whole lot
          of growth.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 text-center">
          If you made it this far I want to say thank you. The last four years
          have been filled with challenges, growth, and transformation. I'm just
          excited to get back to work — this time, doing what I love: coding.
